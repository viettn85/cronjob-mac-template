This guide is for cronjobs on MacOS from https://betterprogramming.pub/https-medium-com-ratik96-scheduling-jobs-with-crontab-on-macos-add5a8b26c30


1) In Finder go to: Go menu -> Go to Folder -> "/usr/sbin/cron".
2)Drag and drop cron and smdb icons to : System Preferences -> Security and Privacy -> Privacy -> Full Disk Access (maybe you will need to unlock in the bottom left lock icon).

Replace SCRIPT_LOCATION on this guide and work.sh by your local folder path

Create a cronjob
Run crontab -e
Add this command:
*/1 * * * * cd SCRIPT_LOCATION && ./work.sh

For testing, you can add stdout for echo commands

*/1 * * * * cd SCRIPT_LOCATION && ./work.sh >/tmp/stdout.log 2>/tmp/stderr.log

List active cronjobs:
Run crontab -l
